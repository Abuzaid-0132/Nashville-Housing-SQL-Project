# Nashville-Housing-SQL-Project
This project focuses on cleaning and transforming raw housing data in SQL Server. The dataset, Nashville_Housing, contains property records with inconsistent, duplicate, and incomplete values. Using SQL techniques, I systematically cleaned the dataset to prepare it for reliable analysis.
